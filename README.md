# Personal Website

Hey! Welcome to my personal website. This is where I showcase my coursework, experience, projects, and other stuff I've been working on.

## What's Here

- **About**: A bit about me and what I'm up to
- **Experience**: Places I've worked and what I did there
- **Coursework**: Classes I've taken at UC Berkeley, organized by semester
- **Campus Organizations**: Groups I'm involved with on campus
- **Projects**: Some projects I've built or worked on
- **Teaching**: My teaching and tutoring experience
- **Contact**: Ways to reach me

## Tech Stack

Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Pretty standard modern web stack.

## Running Locally

If you want to run this locally (maybe you want to fork it for your own site?):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Project Structure

The main stuff is in:
- `app/` - Next.js app directory with the main page and layout
- `components/` - React components for each section
- `public/images/` - Images for profile, projects, company logos, etc.

## Notes

- The site has `noindex` set so search engines won't index it (it's meant to be shared via direct link)
- Large files like PDFs and images are gitignored
- Feel free to fork this and make it your own!
